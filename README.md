```
open URNACE SIMULATION REALLLLLLL\FURNACE SIMULATION REALLLLLLL\bin\Debug
FURNACE SIMULATION REALLLLL.exe
```


## Prerequisites

```
Net framework >= 3.5 - Recommended: latest
```

## Calculating Heat temperature of Furnace

```
- First calculate Enrichment of oxygen, ( Percent )
- and then, Calculate temperature rise from enrichment
- if wanna calculate temperature rise, u must find maximal temperature (100%)
```
